GCTB is a software tool that comprises Bayesian mixed 
linear models for complex trait analyses using genome-wide 
SNPs. Version 2.03 beta includes a more robust parameterisation 
for the previously implemented summary-data-based models, e.g. SBayesR and SBayesS.

One key feature of this version is that when a convergence problem is detected 
(indicated by a negative residual variance), the program will automatically restart the
MCMC and switch to the more robust parameterisation for sampling. This more robust
parameterisation can also be directly invoked by including flag --robust in the command line,
e.g.,

gctb --sbayes R --robust --mldm [mldm_file] --gwas-summary [gwas_file] --chain-length 6000 --burn-in 1000 --no-mcmc-bin --out $out > $out.log 2>&1


System
------

We provide a statically linked 64-bit Linux executable, 
gctb, that has been tested on several Linux systems. The
software has also been compiled and run on Mac operating
systems but this will require installation. 

Installation
------------

Please see http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb/download/README.html for detailed
installation instructions.

Instructions for use
--------------------

Please see the tutorial on http://cnsgenomics.com/software/gctb
for a detailed description of how to run the summary-based 
components of the GCTB software on the demonstration data
derived from the 1000 Genomes.
